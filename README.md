# Cura Docs

🔗 Live Demo: https://cura-docs.netlify.app

Cura Docs is an AI-first healthcare documentation platform concept designed to simplify, centralize, and streamline medical records while reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals.

---

## Overview

Healthcare data today is often fragmented across systems, files, and formats. Cura Docs is built around the idea of creating a **single, structured, and accessible source of truth** for patient medical documentation.

The project focuses on clarity, usability, and scalability, with a frontend architecture that can later integrate advanced AI-driven workflows.

## Key Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Centralized view of medical documentation
- Scalable frontend architecture
- Designed for future AI integration
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Styling:** CSS / Modern UI practices
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Deployment:** Netlify
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Project Structure

The overall structure and architectural decisions of this project were **designed and implemented by me**.  
AI tools were used **selectively** to assist with:
- Code refinement
- Debugging
- Improving clarity and efficiency

However:
- The **core idea**
- The **application flow**
- The **component structure**
- The **project organization**

were **original and independently planned**.

This project reflects my understanding of frontend development workflows and real-world product thinking.

## Motivation

Doctors and healthcare professionals often spend more time managing records than treating patients. Cura Docs is motivated by the goal of reducing this friction through thoughtful software design and, eventually, AI-powered assistance.

## Current Status

🛠️ **In active development**

Planned future enhancements include:
- Backend integration
- Authentication and role-based access
- Secure data handling
- AI-powered document summarization and insights
